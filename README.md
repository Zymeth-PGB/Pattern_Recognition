# Artificial Dilation
This is the repository for the research work: [Artificial Pupil Dilation for Data Augmentation in Iris Semantic Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9935749). You can also find the paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12733).

Our method artificially changes the dilation level of an iris image to any desired level. The dilation level is defined as the ratio between the pupil radius and the iris radius. This method is based on deterministic equations and sampling techniques so it **doesn't require any training**.

This Data Augmentation (DA) technique **preserves the identity** of the iris in the input image.

The following image illustrates the effects of our data augmentation function. Given the image on the left and its circular segmentation data, the other two images were synthesized. One with a reduced dilation and the other with an increase in dilation.

This repository contains two implementations of the artificial-dilation data-augmentation function. One in Python and one in Matlab. Both contain an updated version of the function, as well as interactive GUI demos. Finally, this repo contains a custom pytorch dataloader for online data augmentation.

## New Pytorch Dataloader!
The best way to train your network with the proposed Artificial Dilation DA plus traditional DA by [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/) is copying the file **./Pytorch/DilationDataloader.py** and pasting it into your repo.

To use it you will need to provide the paths to the iris images, the paths to the target semantic masks plus the segmentation data. Examples of these inputs can be found in the jupyter notebook: **./Pytorch/Dataloader Design.ipynb**. Then, you can make pytorch datasets and dataloaders using the following commands:

```python
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from DilationDataloader import dilated_iris_dataset

dataset = dilated_iris_dataset(segm_CSV_file, iris_paths, mask_paths, transform)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size, shuffle=True)
```

## Python Implementation
### Libraries
The python implementation of the function utilizes only numpy and pillow Image to work.

For the demos and tests, these additional libraries are needed: tqdm, pandas, PySimpleGUI and jupyter notebook.

### Usage
The following python command synthesizes im2 with dilation level dil2 (between 0.1 and 0.8), from im1 with dilation level dil1.

```python
from change_dilation_v2 import change_dilation

im2 = change_dilation(im1, dil2, pupil_xyr, iris_xyr)
```

The argument pupil_xyr is the circular segmentation of the pupil in im1, with the format: (xp, yp, rp). Where (xp, yp) is the center of the circle that best fits the pupil and rp is the pupil radius. Likewise, iris_xyr is the circular segmentation of the iris, with the format: (xi, yi, ri).

The script speed_test.py evaluates the processing time of the function when synthesizing 100 images:

```bash
cd Python/
python speed_test.py
```

## Matlab Implementation
### Usage
The Matlab implementation requires Matlab's Image Processing Toolbox to work.

The command is identical to the python implementation with the same arguments.

```matlab
im2 = change_dilation(im1, dil2, pupil_xyr, iris_xyr);
```

### Manual Segmentation
You can segment your own images manually using the script: **./Matlab/Manual_Segmentation.m**

Change the input and output paths to your own iris dataset, and run the program to start segmenting the pupil and iris of each image. Fist click with the mouse 4 points on the pupil/iris boundary and then click 4 other points in the iris/sclera boundary. Therefore, you must perform 8 consecutive clicks per image. Te program will compute the best fitting circles for the pupil and the iris, and display the results in a new figure. After that, the next image to be segmented will be automatically presented for you to click 8 more times. After the final image has been segmented, the program will save all segmentation data in a single CSV file.

## Demos
Interactive demos are offered with this repository. The user can change in real time the dilation level of provided images using a slide bar.

![alt text](./assets/GUIs.png?raw=true)

The following command runs the pythonÂ´s demo. Moving the slide bar will automatically generate a new iris image with the selected dilation level and display it. To switch images, first select the desired image with the scroll element on top and then press the Apply button.

```bash
cd Python/
python Demo.py
```

The Matlab demo was programmed as a Matlab App. First change directories to the folder named Matlab/ and then execute the following command. The slide bar will change the dilation level in real time, and the scroll element will switch automatically to the desired image.

```matlab
Demo.mlapp
```
